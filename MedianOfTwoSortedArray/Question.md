# [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

<p>There are two sorted arrays <b>nums1</b> and <b>nums2</b> of size m and n respectively.</p>

<p>Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).</p>

<p>You may assume <strong>nums1</strong> and <strong>nums2</strong>&nbsp;cannot be both empty.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
</pre>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre>nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
</pre>
